# Setup

## Shuffle decks
Shuffle the Event deck and the Actions deck thoroughly.

## Pool armies and EUR
All players take equal starting units and EUR based on the number of players:
- Three players: 35 units/EUR
- Four players: 30 units/EUR
- Five players: 25 units/EUR
- Six players: 20 units/EUR

## Place units
All players perform a single *Ranked Bid* to determine both the order of setup and the first game round. The player placing units first also plays first and so forth.

Once the order of setup has been determined, players take turns placing one piece from their starting pool onto an unoccupied territory.

Once all 42 territories have been claimed, players may then continue placing units onto territories they already control. This continues until all players have placed all their starting pieces.

## Choose capital
Once all pieces have been placed. Each player chooses one territory to be their *capital* and places their *capital token* on that territory in the order of setup.

## Draw starting cards
All players draw three cards from the *Action deck* as their starting hand.


# The game round
The game consists of *rounds* in which each player takes exactly one *turn*.

## Round order
Each round proceeds in the following order:

### Determine winner
If any player controls all capitals at the beginning of a *round*, they are declared the winner.

### Draw event card



## Bidding
### How to bid
Throughout the game, players are required to "bid" for an advantage. Bidding is required to determine turn order each round, but is also used to determine order of placement during setup, and as an effect of certain cards.

To bid, each player secretly places EUR tokens equal to their bid in one hand. Player may bid any number of EUR, from nothing up until the total EUR they possess.

When each player has chosen their bid, all players simultaneously reveal the bid in their hands and return all bid EUR to the bank.

### Determining the Winner
There are two forms of bid: *Ranked Bid*, the most common, used for determining turn order; and *Winner-takes-all* used in the effect of certain cards. 

In both cases, ties are broken by dice roll, highest wins, repeating until a winner is determined in case of draws.

#### Ranked bid
In a *Ranked Bid*, the player with the highest bid wins, followed by the player with the second-highest and so forth.

Ranked bids determine *the choice* of order, with the winner choosing their position first, second-place second and so forth. A winner may thus choose to go first, last, or in any position they consider favourable.

#### Winner-takes-all
In a *Winner-takes-all* bid, there may only be one winner. The player with the highest bid wins.
